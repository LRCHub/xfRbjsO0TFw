If you hear me call you, would you be there for me?
If I speak your name out loud, would you feel what I say?
I might move some things 'cause I need to change
I need to change for me but I do nothing for you
Put the blame on me for everything that you do now

Ask me if I'm doing well and I'm fronting
By myself and I'm 'bout to hit a hundred
Said you could tell I'm already off of something
And I'm in Hell, is this really what you wanted?
We always on again and off again
She said, "I liked you more when you ain't have no confidence"
She's sending paragraphs and I just don't respond to it
Was tryna hear you out but I'm already off of it

And I think of you and the spiderwebs
And how they held us together
And I think of you and how you breath
And I hope you do, forever

If you could let me know where I stand, babe
Standing here with an open hand, babe

Put the blame on me, baby, I'm sorry
You gotta wait on me, but c'est la vie
Know it hurts, I'm the worst
Always search for the meaning and I can't find it (I can't find it)
Can you feel these things that I say to you?
Keep it real, you know I won't play with you
Feel like maybe that's what I was made to do
And I don't want everything that I could change for you

Why I can't look at you the same way?
Change place, then maybe we could save face
You pushed me away but I'm a sucker for the chase
And you sent me a message and I don't think I'll erase that
So maybe we should face facts
Me and you together never worked,
But I can't say that (I can't say that)
But I can't say it
Sometimes it feels like we're sinking and I can't save it

The message that you sent me in the night
It used to be the same when I wake up by your side
I see you every time I close my eyes
I wanna make you mine but you can't make up your mind
You ask me, what holds us together
The spiderwebs, they won't last forever
Now I'm a wreck, but I'm gon' remember
The memories, of you I'll always treasure
Of you, I'll always treasure
Of you, I'll always treasure
