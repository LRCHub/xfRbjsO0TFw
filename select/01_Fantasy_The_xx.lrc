[00:12.73] Would you come back August or June, June
[00:17.63] And I hate that tomorrow's December
[00:23.06] But this collision, came mid-bloom
[00:29.33] Better built to resume
[00:33.75] I'll see you August, see you June
[00:39.37] I'm building higher than I can see
[00:45.44] I want fantasy
[00:51.00] Don't rest with the less
[00:53.57] I'm burning to impress
[01:01.10] It's deep in the middle of me
[01:07.33] I can be fantasy
